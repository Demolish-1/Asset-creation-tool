## Theme Changing Feature 🌈

To demonstrate my UI skills, I have added a dynamic theme-changing button that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. This feature enhances user experience by offering a customizable interface, catering to different user preferences.

### How It Works:
- **Button Functionality**: A button is placed on the UI that switches between light and dark themes with a smooth transition. This allows users to choose their preferred theme for a more comfortable browsing experience.
- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth transitions are applied when switching between themes, providing a polished, professional look.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The button is easily accessible and visually appealing, encouraging users to interact with the interface.

Here’s a video demo of the theme switcher in action! 🎥
